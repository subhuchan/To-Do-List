# Simple To-Do List

## Overview
This is a simple, responsive web-based To-Do List application. It allows users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and clear all completed tasks. The tasks are persisted in the browser's local storage, so they remain even if the page is closed and reopened.

## Setup
1.  **Save the file**: Save the provided `index.html` content into a file named `index.html` on your computer.
2.  **Open in browser**: Open the `index.html` file using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Usage
1.  **Add a new task**: Type your task into the input field labeled "Add a new task..." and either click the "Add Task" button or press `Enter`.
2.  **Mark as completed/uncompleted**: Click on a task item to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks will have a strikethrough text and a different background.
3.  **Delete a task**: Click the 'x' button next to a task to permanently remove it from the list.
4.  **Clear completed tasks**: Click the "Clear Completed Tasks" button at the bottom to remove all tasks currently marked as completed.
5.  **Persistence**: Your tasks are automatically saved to your browser's local storage. They will be available the next time you open the application in the same browser.
